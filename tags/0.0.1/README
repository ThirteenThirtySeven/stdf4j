STDF4J

Java library for reading STDF files. Currently only v4 is supported.
Unfortunately, the test cases have been removed due to proprietary data,
but the test class has been included for reference and can be updated to
use any example STDF with corresponding statistics. For our testing we used
an ascii dump of the STDF using libstdf (http://freestdf.sourceforge.net) to
get the statistics for the test files.


BUILDING

This project uses maven (http://maven.apache.org) for building:
mvn clean install

This will build the library and all tools.


RELEASE

In theory the following should release a new version:
mvn release:prepare
mvn release:perform

I have not been able to get that to work with googlecode, however, so
for now I have a specialized 'release' script in the current directory
to help with automating releases. You should be able to run this without
any arguments to create a new release. You will be prompted for the new
release version as well as the next development version. The released version
will be tagged in svn, but no files will be uploaded to googlecode. This
must still be done manually.

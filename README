STDF4J

Java library for reading STDF files. Currently only v4 is supported.
Unfortunately, the test cases have been removed due to proprietary data,
but the test class has been included for reference and can be updated to
use any example STDF with corresponding statistics. For our testing we used
an ascii dump of the STDF using libstdf (http://freestdf.sourceforge.net) to
get the statistics for the test files.

The 'dump' script is included to show how to do an ascii dump of an STDF
using the Dump tool class.
